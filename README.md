> Boring line-of-business application for storing recipes

Simplest RESTful application in the world, just a 
wrapper around interactions with a database.

On a slightly more architectural note, this will be 
be deployed as a service onto a PaaS provider so that 
I can fiddle around with things. The plan is to connect 
this to ElasticSearch as the data store.
