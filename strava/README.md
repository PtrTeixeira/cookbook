# strava

This houses the Go client I wrote for the Strava REST
API (Neither I nor this library are affiliated with or 
Strava and other legal disclaimers).

This client is *very* limited at the moment (and also
very bad). It only supports ~2 endpoints (plus logging
in via OAuth). My strong suggestion is to *not* use this
and generate what you need yourself via the Strava Swagger 
doc.

Good luck!
