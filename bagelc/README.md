Bagel is a permanently work-in-progress programming
language. Why is it called Bagel? It's inspired by 
[Lox](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html)
(in addition to the compilers class I took in college).

What is the key idea behind it? No idea yet. I literally
haven't designed any of the language yet - not the semantics,
not the syntax, not the runtime.
